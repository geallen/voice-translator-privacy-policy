## 1. Information We Collect

We collect the following types of information:

*   **Usage Data:** We collect information about how you use the app, such as the features you use, the languages you translate, and the frequency of use, to improve the app's functionality and user experience.
*   **Ad Data:** We use Google AdMob to display ads in the app. Google may collect and use your data to personalize the ads you see. Please see Google's Privacy Policy for more information on their data collection practices.

## 2. How We Use Your Information

We use your information for the following purposes:

*   Providing translation services: To translate your voice recordings into other languages accurately and efficiently.
*   Improving the App: To analyze usage patterns, identify areas for improvement, and optimize the app's performance.
*   Personalizing user experience: To remember your language preferences, provide a more tailored experience, and offer relevant content.
*   Displaying ads: To generate revenue to support the app's development and maintenance. Ad revenue helps us keep the app free for our users.

## 3. Data Sharing

We may share your information with the following third parties:

*   Encrypting your data in transit using HTTPS.
*   Using secure servers to store your data.
*   Implementing access controls to restrict who can access your data.
*   Regularly monitoring our systems for security vulnerabilities.

However, please be aware that no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is completely secure.

## 5. Data Retention

*   Voice recordings are not stored permanently after the translation is complete. They are only retained temporarily for processing.
*   Translation history is stored locally on your device until you delete it. You have control over your translation history.
*   Device and usage data is retained for 12 months. After 12 months, this data is anonymized or deleted.
