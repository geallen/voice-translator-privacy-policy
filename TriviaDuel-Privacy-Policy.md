Last Updated: May 14, 2025

## Introduction

Thank you for playing TriviaDuel! This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application.

We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal data. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully to understand our practices regarding your personal information.

## Information We Collect

### Information You Provide

- **Player Names**: When you add players to the game, we temporarily store player names in local storage on your device to manage gameplay sessions.
- **Language Preferences**: We store your preferred language setting locally on your device.
- **App Settings**: We store your preferences such as theme settings (dark/light mode) and other customizable options locally on your device.
- **Purchase Information**: If you make in-app purchases (such as removing ads), we process transaction information through our payment processor, RevenueCat.

### Information Collected Automatically

- **Device Information**: We collect information about your device, including device type, operating system version, and unique device identifiers for analytics and error reporting.
- **Game Data**: We collect gameplay statistics such as scores and question responses locally on your device to improve your gaming experience.
- **Ad Interaction**: Unless you've purchased the ad-free version, we collect basic information about your interactions with advertisements through Google Mobile Ads.

### Third-Party Services

- **Google Gemini API**: If you choose to add your own Google Gemini API key, we use it to generate trivia questions. We do not store or process your API key on our servers - it is stored securely on your device. The API processes your question requests but does not store persistent personal data.
